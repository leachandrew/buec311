This week's problems are meant to give you some practice on the basic
tricks you'll need to manipulate supply and demand curves and calculate
equilibrium conditions. In this questions, I've given you multiple steps
intentionally to build habits like checks and double-checks that you'll
want to use. I won't always give these to you on exam questions, but
best to build the habit now.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Suppose that my personal demand curve for coffee is given by
  \(Q=4-\frac{2p}{3}\).

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii})}
  \item
    Draw the inverse demand curve for this function (i.e P as a function
    of Q).
  \item
    How many cups of coffee would you expect me to consume per day at a
    price of \$2 per cup?
  \item
    Find an example (if you can) of what economists would call a
    perverse incentive, or a rule that likely leads to behaviours that
    the professor might prefer to avoid.
  \item
    Consider some of the decisions you've made this Fall to prepare for
    classes. Which decisions would have changed, and how, if you'd had
    access to an extra \$500? How would you have had to change your
    decisions if you received an unexpected bill for \$500?
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Think of an example in your life in which you behave as though you
  were following a demand curve (i.e.~when prices of good X drop, you
  buy more).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Now, consider the opposite. Think of an example in your life in which
  your consumption of a product or service doesn't appear to be related
  to its price or to your income.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  Now, let's switch to the supply side. Can you think of a market or
  firm where you readily see a supply curve functioning like it does in
  an economics textbook?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\item
  We often see discussion of supply and demand approached slightly
  differently in commodity and labour markets than how we approach the
  terms in microeconomics. For example, below is a graph of Energy
  Information Administration global oil demand, showing both historical
  demand and forecasts.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    When commodities analysts talk about demand increasing or decreasing
    over time, what do they mean?
  \item
    What's different about this graphic compared to the demand graphs
    that we use in class?
  \item
    {[}this is a tough question for week 1{]} Does an increase in demand
    as shown in the graph below, for example from 2018 through 2019,
    necessarily mean that there was an increase in demand (i.e.~a shift
    to the right in the demand curve)?
  \end{enumerate}
