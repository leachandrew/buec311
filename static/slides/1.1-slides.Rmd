# Learning Objectives

.pull-left[
- The language of economics
- Economics as a tool for decision making
- Micro vs macro vs managerial economics
- Why economic models are wrong
- When and why we use them
]

# *Micro*-economics

.pull-left[
- individual and firm decision-making

- prices

- labour market decisions

- strategic behaviour and game theory
]

.pull-right[

- sports (?!?!)

- marriage (?!?!)

- criminal behaviour (?!?!)

- pollution (?!?!)

# Micro- vs. Macro-economics

.pull-left[

- What is "an economy?"

- Where do aggregates (GDP, unemployment, & inflation) come from? 

- Micro: Choices and consequences

- Macro: Systemic interaction of choosers & emergent behavior
  - Macro is what happens when you put all the micro together

# What does an economist mean when they say...

.pull-left[

- Terms you "know" from ordinary life mean .hi[very different things] to economists:

> Cost, efficiency, welfare, marginal, profit, public good, discrimination, elasticity, games

- Using these words' "ordinary" meanings will lead to wrong economic conclusions!

- You will need to "relearn" the economic meanings of these words

# Economics has its own vocabulary

.pull-left[

- You'll need to master a new vocabulary:

> externality, marginal rate of transformation, marginal cost, consumer surplus, allocative efficiency

- While we'll try to avoid jargon, I'll be pedantic about certain terms with you because they are important for understanding

# You Can Learn To Think Like an Economist

.pull-left[

- Everyone thinks they are already an economist and can speak this foreign language

- Be humble, and open to new ideas

- Economics is *often* common sense, but it takes time to grasp and apply the tools

- Don't give up too soon

# Why We Model I

.pull-left[

- Economists often "speak" in models that explain and predict human behavior

- The language of models is mathematics

- Mathematical inference is expressed through equations and graphs

- This is what scares students most about economics. Don't let it scare you.

# Why We Model II

- Economists use conceptual models: fictional constructions to logically examine consequences

- Economics is broader than just mathematical models:
    - Economists run experiments
    - Economists analyze data
    - Economists make predictions
    
- Math is a tool, it's not the goal

# Remember: All Models are Wrong!

.content-box-red[
.red[**Caution**:] Don't conflate models with reality!
]
- Models help us *understand* reality.

- A good economist is always aware of:
    - the limits of their model
    - the key underlying assumptions
    - " _ceteris paribus_ " (all else equal)
    - "...and then what?"   (is the system in equilibrium?)
    - "...compared to what?" (counterfactual analysis)

# About This Course

---

# Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you will: 

1. apply the models of economics (constrained optimization and equilibrium) to managerial and government decisions

2. explore the effects of economic and political processes on market performance (competition, market prices, profits and losses, property rights, entrepreneurship, market power, market failures, public policy, government failures)

3. apply the economic way of thinking to real world issues in writing

4. be able to access and interpret relevant economic data
